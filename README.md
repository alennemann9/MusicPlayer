# MusicPlayer
This was a project I completed for my Computer Scienc II class.
The classes Player, NoteConverter, StdAudio and StdDraw were provided.
This project was my first experience with object oriented programming.
I was tasked with creating class Wire from which SimulatedWire, PianoWire,
and HarpsichordWire inherit that goes through the process of striking a wire
in order to play a sound. Class StringedInstrument from which ElectricPiano,
Harpsichord, and Piano inherit creates the ArrayList that will be changed based
on the notes. All txt files are example files of music that can be played.
